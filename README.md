# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1:
import the math function. 
### Step 2:
define the coordinates of two points 
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4:
calculate the euclidean distance using the distance formula. 
### Step 5: 
print tge result with two decimal points
### PROGRAM:
```

import math
x1,x2 = 4,10
y1,y2 = 2,6
distance = math.sqrt((x2-x1)**2+(y2-y1)**2)
print(f'{distance:.2f}')
```
  


### OUTPUT:
![output 3](https://github.com/feryjfgkuyfgewjfgew/DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS/assets/150319377/2eb2956c-ebd6-4657-8e4a-d406c6306e0d)



### RESULT:
thus the distance between two points is found sucessfully.
